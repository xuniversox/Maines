# Maines

Sick and tired of having to tell everyone who your main is; maybe your using an archaic and obsolete addon to make it happen through chat however
with Maines it's an contemporary more and or less update with customizable features and a visually user-friendly interface

It's so simple to use; basically type /maines and type in the very obvious edit box in the middle exactly your mains name with the spaces after 

like so:

main name (white space)


not like this:

main name



if you don't put the white space then whatever your saying will be clasped to your main name; I'm still trying to figure out how to solve this

Beyond that you can literally type anything into that editbox and it will be right next your name
just remember that white space after your main name and it's all set.

In the interface option panel for maines is various
bracket options if you can't be bothered to put them in yourself within the maines editbox

you have for now and more to come:

<> angle
[] square
() circle
{} curly

Versioning for this addon works with a concept; came up with called Stamp

[0] Stamp [o] 

is basically beta
whatever the next stamp will be that's going to be the next version it should be obvious after this.

I will update this page with more aesthetics and beautiful stuff; when mentally ready to do so <3

(PLEASE POST COMMENTS, SUGGESTION AND WHATEVER ELSE IN CURSEFORGE FOR NOW)
